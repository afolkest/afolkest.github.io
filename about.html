                <p>Where does spacetime tear apart? Is it only at the Big Bang
                and inside black holes, or is the phenomenon more widespread? This
                is one of the central questions I worked on during my PhD at MIT and my
                postdoc at UC Davis. I attacked the question leveraging the deep connection
                between gravity and quantum information theory.<br><br>

                Before that I've been Fulbright scholar, and I also spent a year at CERN working on particle detectors,
                before realizing that the screwdriver is better entrusted to someone else.<br><br>

                These days I work on using LLMs to build powertools for scientists at the startup Undermind. We arguably
                have the most comprehensive scientific literature search engine out there.<br><br>

                Outside work I produce electronic music, make visual arts, and write
                <a href="https://extramediumplease.substack.com/">Mechanics of Aesthetics</a>.
                I've recently also started tinkering with writing visual arts software and algorithms. 
                I'm currently writing a drawing program using elliptic boundary value problems as the fundamental artistic primitive.
