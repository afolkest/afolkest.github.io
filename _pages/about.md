I'm an MIT theoretical physics PhD working at the AI startup Undermind,
developing AI agent systems for science.

I was formerly postdoctoral scholar at QMAP, UC Davis. My former academic
research was on classical and quantum gravity, leveraging connections between
gravity, diferential geometry, and quantum information theory through the
holographic prinicple and AdS/CFT.
